title: 'About me'
---

I began my professional career as a C# programmer, working for a Canadian SAAS company for over two years. I left to get an MBA however, thinking I wanted to switch into consulting.

After graduating, I worked as a software consultant for over three years until I started a coding bootcamp, Código Lab, in Colombia. While it did not gain the traction we had hoped for, this experience taught me how much I missed coding.

I've spent the last few months reskilling with resources like Código Lab's curriculum and freeCodeCamp's self-paced Web development certifications. These resources and others have provided me a solid foundation in JavaScript Web development.

I am very excited to return to the software development world and help build cool stuff while continuing to learn and grow alongside senior developers!
