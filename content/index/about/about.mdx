title: 'About me'
---

My career has come full circle as I've come to the realization that software development is what I love doing. To me, there's no better feeling than building something tangible.

Despite completing a postgraduate certificate in computer programming and having worked as a programmer analyst at a Canadian SAAS company for over 2 years, I left that role to pursue an MBA thinking I wanted to become a consultant.

Most recently, I co-founded a coding bootcamp in Colombia that while unfortunately did not gain the traction we had hoped for, it reignited my passion for software development.

In addition to learning our bootcamp's curriculum, I complimented my knowledge with freeCodeCamp's self-paced Web development certifications and together they have provided me a solid foundation in JavaScript Web development.

I'm excited to put my skills into helping build cool stuff while continuing to learn and grow as a developer alongside seasoned mentors.
