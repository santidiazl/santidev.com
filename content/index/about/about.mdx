title: 'About me'
---

I began my professional career as a programmer and worked for a Canadian SAAS company for over two years. I left to get an MBA however, thinking I wanted to make a switch into consulting.

After graduating, I worked as a software consultant for almost 4 years until I started a coding bootcamp based in Colombia. While it did not gain the traction we had hoped for, this experience taught me how much I missed the software development world.

I've spent the last few months refreshing my skills through resources like CÃ³digo Lab's curriculum and freeCodeCamp's self-paced Web development certifications. These resources have provided me a solid foundation in JavaScript Web development.

I'm excited to help build cool stuff while continuing to learn and grow as a developer alongside seasoned mentors.
