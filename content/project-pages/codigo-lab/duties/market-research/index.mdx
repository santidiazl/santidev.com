We wanted to get a pulse on what the Colombian job market for developers was like, as well as have a database of relevant jobs we thought our students could apply to.

Initially, I started going through job posts manually and capturing key data points (i.e. tech stack, years experience, pay) in a spreadsheet.

I quickly realized this approach was not viable so I searched for some options that would allow me to scrape these jobs posts. I discovered Python's Beautiful Soup library and with it, I created some scripts that scraped relevant job posts for key data points - saving me an enormous amount of time.
