A real-time instant messaging app. Its front-end was built with React/MUI and its back-end with Express/Node.js. For its database, it uses PostgreSQL, which is interacted with via the Sequelize ORM.

In addition to ensuring messages were sent and delivered in realtime, I was tasked with adding unread message counts and read receipts features.
