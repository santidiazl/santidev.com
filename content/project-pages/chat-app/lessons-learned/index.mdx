title: 'Lessons learned'
---

<h4>Understanding source code</h4>Having a solid grasp of the initial source code by clarifying any
knowledge gaps through additional learning or by asking my evaluators really paid off and resulted
in a holistic learning experience. I did this before writing a single line of code which I believe
saved me considerable time in the end.
<br />

<h4>Redux state management</h4> I had limited exposure to Redux, as the apps I've built have handled
state with the React <code>useState</code> and <code>useReducer</code> hooks. I learned why Redux is
such a powerful tool for managing state in cases where app state is changed frequently and the logic
for updating state is complex, such as for a Web app handling data in realtime.

I learned some common Redux patterns, such as separating async logic through the use of thunks and structuring reducer logic based on 'slices' of state.

<h4>Socket.IO</h4> I had alot of fun working with this library despite not having worked with it before.
I learned the difference between the WebSocket protocol and HTML long-polling for client/server communications
and how this library will fall back to the former when a WebSocket connection is not possible.

<h4>SQL ORM</h4> I learned some of the benefits of using an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) library for
interacting with the app's underlying database, including being able to write data models in JavaScript
and keep them in one place. This makes it much easier to update, maintain, or reuse the code.
