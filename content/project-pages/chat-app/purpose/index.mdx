This app was built as an evaluation of my full-stack Web development abilities and I was given permission to include it on my website.

I was provided a non-functional starter repo and tasked with making it a a real-time messaging app with some additional features.
It was quite challenging, but taught me some valuable lessons that definitely made me a better JavaScript Full Stack developer.
