I was also tasked with adding a read receipt in the form of the recipient's avatar displaying below the <strong>last read</strong> message.

This was also quite tricky as it required adding a new Socket.IO event that would be emitted when a recipient has unread messages in a chat and makes that chat active.

On the client (in this case, the message sender) side, I would need to capture this event and trigger a Redux <code>dispatch</code> call that would update the sender's store by updating the ID of the last read message.

When rendering messages in the active chat, if a message is flagged as last read, that message will include the avatar of the recipient, indicating it was read.
