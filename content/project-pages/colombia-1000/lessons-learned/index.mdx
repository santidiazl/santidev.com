<h4>Displaying tabular data</h4>I debated between using a grid layout or a table element to display
the rows of data representing companies. However, I opted for a table for semantic reasons - a table
semantically indicates tabular data, which is what I wanted to display.

<h4>React Hooks</h4> I got to understand the <code>useEffect</code> hook alot more to handle side-effects,
specifically, async data fetching. When filtering by region or company name, I decided to use <code>
  setState
</code> to trigger <code>useEffect</code> which then made async API requests. I also created a custom
hook for this logic since I wanted to separate it from my home component.

<h4>Data transformation</h4>
The data was not in the friendliest formats. All strings were in upper case and had legal abbreviations
included, and money values were just unformatted numbers. I wrote some helper functions to transform
the source data into formatted, user-friendly values. I also used JavaScript's global <code>
  Intl
</code> object to format numbers into Colombian Pesos.

<h4>API requests</h4>I created a separate file for my API requests. One call handled company queries
for initial load, searching by region/name, or clicking the previous/next buttons. The other was a
call to get all distinct regions, used to populate the region dropdown options. The <code>
  URLSearchParams
</code> Web API that converts an object into a URL query string for the <code>fetch()</code> call
was very useful.
