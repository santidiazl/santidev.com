I'm working on adding routes with React Router so that a user can click on a company name and be routed to its own page. This company page will display some additional data available through the Socrata API and some additional information I am hoping to grab through Wikipedia's API.

I also need to optimize it for mobile devices, including adding media queries that will hide columns on smaller screen sizes.
