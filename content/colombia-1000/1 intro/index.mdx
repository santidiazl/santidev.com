<a href="https://colombia1000.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Colombia 1000</a> is a front-end project I built to better understand how to consume 3rd party APIs in a TypeScript/React
application and fetch, query, and display their data.

It displays a list of Colombia's 1000 largest companies by revenue, as well as other key business metrics.
