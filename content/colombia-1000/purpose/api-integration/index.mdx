I recently came across the Government of Colombia's 'Datos Abiertos' (Open Data) website, which hosts a treasure trove of data published by hundreds of government entities all accessible to the public programatically. The API platform to access this data is the <a href="https://dev.socrata.com/" target="_blank">Socrata Open Data API</a>, which many governments, non-profits, and NGOs use to host their open data.

I decided I would build a Front End for one of these datasets, and given my interest in business and economics, I landed on the 1000 largest Colombian companies one.
