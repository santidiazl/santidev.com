I wanted to be able to filter the list by region or by company name, which required using the Socrata API's querying functionality.

Fortunately, Socrata's excellent documentation for its RESTful API made writing queries fairly straightforward.

I also wanted to see how I would go about updating state in response to these query results in order to gain a better understanding of managing state in React.
