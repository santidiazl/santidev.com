<h4>Displaying tabular data</h4>
I debated between using a grid layout or a table element to display the rows of data representing companies.
However, I opted for a table for semantic reasons - a table semantically indicates tabular data.

<h4>Custom hooks</h4> I learned a lot about the <code>useEffect</code> hook and how it is meant to handle side-effects,
such as async data fetching. Filtering of the companies is done by querying the API via a custom async
data-fetching hook.

<h4>Data cleanup</h4>
Helper functions were crucial for transforming the source data into formatted, user-friendly values.
For example, I used JavaScript's global <code>Intl</code> object to format numbers into Colombian Pesos.

<h4>API requests</h4>
To make requests, I opted for using the browser's native <code>fetch</code> API, with a light wrapper around it for configuration.
