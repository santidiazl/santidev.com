<h4>Data table</h4>I debated between using a grid layout or a table element to display the rows of
data representing companies. However, I opted for a table for semantic reasons - a table
semantically indicates tabular data, which is what I wanted to display. It also lent itself nicely
to queries and re-rendering of results.

<h4>Hooks</h4> I got to understand the useEffect hook alot more to handle side-effects, specifically,
data fetching. I used setState to trigger useEffect calls which called the API. I created a custom hook
for this logic since there was quite a bit of it and I wanted to separate it from my home component.

<h4>Data results</h4>
The data was not in the friendliest format - strings were all caps and had legal abbreviations included,
and money values were just numeric. I wrote some helper functions that I wrapped in a composed function
and it returned a formatted, user-friendly value. I also got to use the Intl object to format numbers
into Colombian Pesos.

<h4>API</h4>I created a separate file for my API calls, which I then exported as an object. One call
handled company queries for initial load, searching by region/name, or clicking the previous/next
buttons. The other was a call to get all distinct regions, used to populate the region dropdown
options. I learned about the URLSearchParams API to turn an object into a URL params string for the
fetch() call.
