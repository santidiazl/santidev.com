<h4>Data table</h4>I debated between using a grid layout or a table element to display the rows of
data representing companies. However, I opted for a table for semantic reasons - a table
semantically indicates tabular data, which is what I wanted to display.

<h4>Hooks</h4> I got to understand the <code>useEffect</code> hook alot more to handle side-effects,
specifically, async data fetching. I decided to use <code>setState</code> to trigger <code>
  useEffect
</code> calls which then made an async request to the API. I also created a custom hook for this logic
since I wanted to separate it from my home component.

<h4>Data results</h4>
The data was not in the friendliest format - strings were all caps and had legal abbreviations included,
and money values were just numeric. I wrote some helper functions that I wrapped in a composed function
which returned a formatted, user-friendly value. I also used JavaScript's global <code>
  Intl
</code> object to format numbers into Colombian Pesos.

<h4>API</h4>I created a separate file for my API calls, which I then exported as an object. One call
handled company queries for initial load, searching by region/name, or clicking the previous/next
buttons. The other was a call to get all distinct regions, used to populate the region dropdown
options. The <code>URLSearchParams</code> API to turn an object into a URL query string for the <code>
  fetch
</code> API call was very useful.
