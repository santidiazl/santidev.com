Colombia 1000 is a project I am working on to better understand how to integrate third-party APIs into Web applications in order to fetch, query, and display data.

It integrates with the Socrata API for its data source and displays a list of Colombia's 1000 largest companies by revenue, as well as some other key business metrics. I was partly inspired by Forbes' famous Global 2000 list.

By default, the app will list 100 results per page, but users can also filter it by region or company name.
