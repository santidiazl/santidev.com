The API platform I used to access my app's data was the <a href="https://dev.socrata.com/" target="_blank">Socrata Open Data API</a>, which many governments, non-profits, and NGOs use to host their open data.

Given my interest in business and economics I chose Colombia's 1000 largest companies, which was made public by a governmental agency in Colombia using Socrata.
