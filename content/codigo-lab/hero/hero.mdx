We started Código Lab because we noticed that Colombia's tech sector, with Y Combinator unicorns like Rappi leading the charge, was booming and needed more Web developers than it could hire.

We wanted to play a part in filling this demand by teaching how to code in a country that has traditionally favoured business, law, and medical degrees over STEM ones.
