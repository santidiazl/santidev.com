By far the most rewarding part of this experience was helping our two cohorts of students (7 total) learn new skills that made them more competitive in Colombia's job market.

We developed an excellent curriculum with the help of a tech education consultant, and I had the opportunity to adjust it for the local market based on the job posts research I conducted.

We recruited students that had at least a limited working proficiency in English, but there were times when I had to step in and clarify things further in Spanish, which was a great way for me to learn the concepts.

I also got to see firsthand how empowering and satisfying it felt for our students to build something from scratch with code, and that experience led me to want to return to writing code for a living.
