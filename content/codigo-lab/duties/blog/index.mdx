We thought content marketing would be an important strategy to build awareness and credibility as newcomers, which is why we decided to have a blog. Our blog was also based on a Gatsby starter and used the Git/Netlify continuous deployment workflow.

Using the data we gathered from my Python scraper, I used Python's Pandas library to conduct some analysis, and I published some posts that summarized our findings while also highlighting the growth in jobs requiring skills from our curriculum's tech stack.
