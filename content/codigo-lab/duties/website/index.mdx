I handled most marketing duties including maintaining our Gatsby-based website. Gatsby was my first introduction to the React ecosystem and it was fun to build onto our starter with React. I also got exposure to deployment, using the Git/Netlify workflow.

Some of the functionality I added to our website was routes to additional pages from our index page and a contact form component with Netlify integration.
