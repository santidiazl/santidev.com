By far the most rewarding part of this experience was helping our two cohorts of students (7 total) learn new skills that made them more competitive in Colombia's job market.

We developed an excellent curriculum with the help of a US-based tech education consultant, and using the results of my data analysis I adjusted it to better reflect the needs of Colombia's tech job market.

We recruited students that had at least a limited working proficiency in English, and although I was not an instructor, I stepped in when I could to clarify things further in Spanish. This was a great way for me to learn the concepts.

I also got to see firsthand how empowering and satisfying it felt for our students to build something from scratch with code.
